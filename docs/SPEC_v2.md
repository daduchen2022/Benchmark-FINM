# Quant Interview Benchmark — v2.0 Specification

**Status**: locked. Any change to the items below requires a version bump.
**Spec date**: 2026-05-20.

## Why v2.0 (vs v1.x)
v1.x mixed a code-based grader (regex + tolerance + word-boundary) with an LLM equivalence judge selected by `answer_type`. The code grader was a recurring source of false negatives — it didn't understand `√5`, `\frac{a}{b}` with annotations, percentages in some contexts, sentence-form string answers, etc. v2.0 collapses everything to a single path: every (model, question) pair is graded by Claude Sonnet 4.6 as judge.

| v1.x | v2.0 |
|---|---|
| Code grader (number / string / choice) + LLM judge (open) | LLM judge for **everything** |
| `answer_type` dispatches different graders | `answer_type` kept as informational metadata only |
| `tolerance` field controls numerical fuzz | Judge interprets numerical closeness; field ignored |
| `judge_extract` then separate `llm_equivalence_check` | One unified `judge_answer` call returns (verdict, extracted, reasoning) |

Results from v1.x and v2.0 are not directly comparable.

## 1. Models

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Number of models | 10 |
| Provider | OpenRouter (single key) |
| Version pinning | All `model_id`s are concrete versions |
| Auto-routing | Disabled |

### Models that don't honor `temperature` / `top_p`

OpenRouter silently drops the sampling params for these; `sampling_controlled=false` is recorded on every Result row for them:

- `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7-fast`
- `openai/gpt-5.5`
- `openai/gpt-chat-latest`

Canonical list lives in `pipeline/models.py`.

## 2. Prompts

### Model under test — system prompt
```
You are answering a quantitative-finance interview question. Think step by step.
After your reasoning, clearly state your final answer at the end.
```

No strict "Final answer: X" format requirement (the judge sees the full reply, so a strict format would only penalize models with different answering styles).

### Model under test — user prompt
The bare question text from `data/questions.json`, no preamble.

### Judge — system prompt
```
你是一个评分助手。给你一道题、标准答案、以及某个模型的完整回复，你判断模型回复中最终
给出的答案是否正确。

判定原则：
1. 看模型最终结论，而不是中间推理。
2. 容忍合理的表达差异：数值（0.667 ≈ 0.6667 ≈ 2/3）、数学符号（√5 ≈ 2.236）、
   分数（1/4 ≈ 0.25 ≈ 25%）、公式（latex 形式互通）、时间（11:23am ≈ 37 min before noon）、
   语义（down ≈ decreases ≈ water falls）。
3. 如果题目问多个东西，模型只要把标准答案对应的那部分答对即可。
4. 如果模型没给出可识别的最终答案，verdict 写 NO。

输出格式（严格 3 行）：
  第 1 行：模型给出的最终答案（≤30 字）
  第 2 行：判定理由（≤30 字）
  第 3 行：YES 或 NO
```

### Judge — user prompt
```
题目：{question}
标准答案：{expected}
模型回复（完整，可能截尾到末尾 4000 字符）：
{raw_response_last_4000_chars}
```

## 3. Inference / sampling parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `temperature` | 0.0 | Honored by 7 of 10 models |
| `top_p` | 1.0 | Same |
| `max_tokens` | 8192 | Generous so long CoT isn't truncated |
| `seed` | not set | Not all models honor it |
| Reasoning effort | Model default | Not overridden |
| Sampling strategy | Single pass | No majority vote |
| Per-call timeout | 180s model / 60s judge | Hung providers can't block the run |

---

## 4. Tool permissions

All disabled. v2.0 measures native reasoning.

| Tool | v2.0 |
|---|---|
| Web search | Disabled |
| Code execution | Disabled |
| Calculator | Disabled |
| RAG | Disabled |
| Function calling | Disabled |

---

## 5. Dataset

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Size | 26 questions (11 brainteasers + 15 probability) |
| Format | JSON array in `data/questions.json` |
| Required fields | `id`, `question`, `answer` |
| Optional metadata | `topic`, `difficulty`, `answer_type` |
| Originality | User-curated; classic problems present (training-leakage risk noted) |
| Locking | Dataset locked before a benchmark run; no edits mid-run |

`answer_type` and `tolerance` (if present) are ignored by the grader — they exist for human navigation / future analysis only. All grading goes through the LLM judge regardless.

**Important rule for dataset editing**: never paraphrase a question to "clarify" it or add unstated assumptions. If a question is ambiguous, that ambiguity is part of the test. Fix only encoding artifacts (e.g. `Ã` → `×`) and JSON-syntax errors.

---

## 6. Grading — LLM-as-judge (the only path)

For every (model, question) pair:

1. Send the question to the model under test → get `raw_response`
2. Send `(question, expected, raw_response)` to the judge model → get a 3-line structured reply:
   - Line 1: the model's final answer, extracted verbatim (≤30 chars)
   - Line 2: a brief reason for the verdict (≤30 chars)
   - Line 3: `YES` or `NO`
3. Store `correct = (line 3 == YES)`, `extracted_answer = line 1`, `judge_reasoning = full 3-line text`

The judge is a single Claude Sonnet 4.6 call. It sees the full raw response (last 4000 chars). It does not see `answer_type` or `tolerance` — only the natural-language question, the expected answer, and the model's reply.

**Per-question scoring**: binary 0 / 1.
**Partial credit**: none.
**Human review**: required before publishing a leaderboard. Use `judge_reasoning` to spot-check the judge's decisions.

## 7. Evaluation protocol

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Call granularity | 1 model call + 1 judge call per (model, question) |
| Question order | ID-sorted (independent calls → no order effect) |
| Retry policy | None in v2.0 |
| Concurrency | 8 simultaneous in-flight calls (configurable via `--concurrency`) |
| Output format errors | If the judge returns < 3 lines, parse defensively; verdict defaults to NO |

### Logged fields per (model, question) row

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `model` | Display name from `pipeline/models.py` |
| `question_id` | Question ID |
| `correct` | Boolean — judge's YES/NO |
| `extracted_answer` | Judge's line 1 — the model's final answer as the judge identified it |
| `expected_answer` | Dataset's reference answer |
| `raw_response` | Full unmodified model output |
| `judge_reasoning` | Full 3-line judge response (for audit) |
| `latency_s` | Wall-clock seconds for the model call (judge call not included) |
| `sampling_controlled` | `false` if the model drops `temperature` / `top_p` |
| `error` | Error type + message, or `null` |

### Output files (per run, timestamped)

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `details_<ts>.json` | One row per (model, question) — all fields above |
| `summary_<ts>.json` | Per-model totals + `wrong_ids` + `error_ids` + `sampling_controlled` |
| `scores_<ts>.csv` | Model × question matrix + score + accuracy + sampling flag |

## 8. How to run

```bash
LLM/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt          # one-time
cp .env.example .env                             # then fill OPENROUTER_API_KEY
LLM/bin/python run_benchmark.py                  # or: source LLM/bin/activate && python run_benchmark.py
```

Per run: 260 model calls + 260 judge calls = ~520 OpenRouter requests, ~$1–2.

## 9. Known v2.0 limitations

1. **Sample size 26** — still small; v2.x should grow it.
2. **No retry on transient errors** — a single API failure leaves that cell as `error`.
3. **Training-data contamination risk** — classic interview problems may be memorized.
4. **3 of 10 models can't have controlled sampling** — qualified via `sampling_controlled` flag.
5. **Judge accuracy is a single point of failure** — every grading decision depends on Sonnet. Audit `judge_reasoning` before publishing.
6. **No tool use** — doesn't reflect realistic LLM usage today.
7. **Some questions in the dataset are ambiguous (e.g. p03's "I pick a number" — is it uniform or adversarial?)**. By design, we do NOT paraphrase to disambiguate; the judge sees the question as-is. Ambiguity affects all models equally, so it doesn't bias the comparison — but it lowers the absolute scores.
