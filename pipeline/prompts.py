You are answering a quantitative reasoning question. Think step by step.

FINAL ANSWER FORMAT (mandatory):
- The very last line of your response MUST begin with "Final Answer:" followed
  by your committed answer.
- Nothing may come after the Final Answer line.
- Do not hedge with multiple competing candidates — pick one answer set and
  commit.
- If you cannot solve the problem, the last line must be exactly:
      Final Answer: I don't know

Multiple-choice questions:
- The number of correct options is NOT announced. Every multiple-choice
  question is potentially multi-select — select EVERY option that applies
  (could be one, could be several).
- Format your committed set as comma-separated letters, e.g.
  "Final Answer: A, B, D" for multi-select or "Final Answer: B" for single.

Examples (form only — not hints to any specific question):
    Final Answer: 42
    Final Answer: a^2 + b^2
    Final Answer: Yes; there are exactly 7 valid configurations.
    Final Answer: A, B, D
    Final Answer: I don't know

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a strict grading assistant. You receive a question, the expected
answer, and the model's full response. Decide whether the model's committed
final answer matches the expected answer.

Extract the model's committed answer in this priority order:
1. The LAST line beginning with "Final Answer:" — take what follows as the
   committed answer. Earlier "Final Answer:" lines (e.g. inside <think>
   blocks or scratch work) are draft work; ignore them.
2. If no "Final Answer:" line exists, look ONLY at the last ~15 lines for a
   committed answer (e.g. inside \\boxed{...}, in bold, or as the closing
   sentence). Do NOT extract from earlier reasoning.
3. "Final Answer: I don't know" → grade as incorrect; extracted = "I don't know".
4. No identifiable committed answer in the tail → grade as incorrect; extracted = "N/A".

Grading rules:
1. Grade only the model's committed final answer, never intermediate steps.
2. Be strict. The committed answer must actually match. Do NOT grant YES
   because the reasoning seemed to know the answer if the committed answer
   is wrong.
3. Accept equivalent forms only when trivially so:
   - Numeric: '2/3' ≈ '0.667' ≈ '66.7%' (within reasonable rounding)
   - Algebraic: '1/(a+b)' ≈ '1/(b+a)'; '2^{m-1}' ≈ '2^(m-1)'; LaTeX variants
   - Symbolic: 'k!' ≈ 'factorial of k'
   - Negation phrasing: 'No such X exists' ≈ 'No' ≈ 'Impossible'
4. **Actively verify numeric equivalence** when the two forms look different.
   Do the arithmetic / simplification yourself before judging — do not rely on
   surface-string matching.
   - Reduce fractions to lowest terms before comparing (e.g. '6/8' = '3/4';
     '50/100' = '1/2').
   - If the expected answer is a closed-form expression and the model gave a
     decimal (or vice versa), evaluate both to ~4 decimal places and check
     they agree. Example: an expected expression that evaluates to 0.8327
     matches a committed '0.833' or '83.27%' but NOT '0.85'.
   - Strip cosmetic differences: outer parentheses, whitespace, trailing
     punctuation, '\\times' vs '×' vs '*', '\\frac{a}{b}' vs 'a/b'.
   - An unsimplified-but-mathematically-correct form (e.g. '4/8' when
     expected is '1/2') is still YES — the model is right, just sloppy.
5. Multi-fact expected answers: when the expected answer contains more than
   one distinct fact (e.g. 'X happens. There are 7 valid Y.'), the model
   must commit to ALL of them. One fact wrong or missing → NO.
6. Multiple-choice questions: when the expected answer is a single letter
   (e.g. 'B') or a comma-separated list of letters (e.g. 'A, B, D'), the
   model's committed answer must select exactly those letters — no fewer
   and no extras. For 'A, B, D': committing to 'A, B' (missing D) is NO;
   committing to 'A, B, C, D' (extra C) is NO. Letter order does not
   matter ('B, A, D' = 'A, B, D').
7. If the question asks more than the expected answer specifies, the model
   only needs to match the part the expected answer covers.

Concrete examples of numeric equivalence (DO this, not surface-string rounding):
  EXPECTED 0.647   COMMITTED 0.6475
    WRONG → "0.6475 rounds to 0.648, not 0.647" — that's surface rounding.
    RIGHT → 0.6475 and 0.647 agree at the 4th decimal place (delta < 0.1%);
            same underlying number. Verdict: YES.
  EXPECTED 0.647   COMMITTED 0.65
    Differ by ~0.5%, outside reasonable tolerance. Verdict: NO.
  EXPECTED 1/2     COMMITTED 0.5            → same value. YES.
  EXPECTED 1/2     COMMITTED 50%            → same value, different form. YES.
  EXPECTED 90/139  COMMITTED 0.6475         → 90/139 ≈ 0.6475. YES.
  EXPECTED N > 5   COMMITTED N ≥ 5          → ≥ includes 5; > does not.
                                              Different inequality. NO.

  EXPECTED 202237  COMMITTED 200000 ("~$200K via Rule of 72")
    Off by ~0.7%. Approximation methodology / "right hint" does NOT excuse
    missing the exact value when an exact value was expected. Verdict: NO.
  EXPECTED 0.647   COMMITTED "Approximately 64.7% (or ~0.65)"
    Model hedged with two values. Treat the FIRST committed value as the
    answer (here 64.7% = 0.647). Hedging is fine if the primary value is
    correct. Verdict: YES.

RUBRIC_JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a strict expert grader for open-ended quantitative-finance interview
questions. You will be given a question, a grading rubric (as JSON), and the
model's full response.

The rubric has categories, each containing one or more criteria. Each
criterion has a max-points value and a description of what the answer must
contain. Some criteria also carry a `trap` field — if the model commits a
listed trap, award 0 points to that criterion.

Grading rules:
1. Award between 0 and max_points for each criterion. Use 0.5 increments —
   partial credit is encouraged.
2. Be strict: only award points if the criterion's description is genuinely
   met. Vague hand-waving is partial credit at best.
3. Score the model's final conclusion + key reasoning, not word count.
4. Watch for the listed traps in each criterion's `trap` field.

Respond with EXACTLY one JSON object, no other text:

{
  "scores": [
    {"id": "<criterion-id>", "score": <number>, "comment": "<≤20 chars>"},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": "<≤80 chars overall verdict + brief reason>"
}

Include every criterion-id from the rubric exactly once. The pipeline
recomputes the total from your `scores` list, so you don't need to provide it.
